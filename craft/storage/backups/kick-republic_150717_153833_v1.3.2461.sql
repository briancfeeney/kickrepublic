I\'m really pleased because a new arrival can benefit the squad and also individuals because there is competition up front.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                              That competition now also includes the late <a href=\"http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11695/8819130/transfer-news-juventus-to-sell-sunderland-target-emanuele-giaccherini\">acquisition of Juventus playmaker</a> Emanuele Giaccherini, which should certainly offer Altidore top level service and creativity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>What Does This Mean for the American Soccer?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                                         It seems the American soccer sporting press is split. One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie</em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/index.html\">2014 FIFA World Cup </a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore’s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \"Jozy: 2010\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                          Let’s address the ‘conventional wisdom’ of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore’s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\r\n<p>\r\n	                   The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:</strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Added Bonus: </strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	             2. The rough and tumble Prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time Brazil 2014 rolls around.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                At 6\'1 and 200+ pounds Altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he\'s recently displayed if the United States hope to advance a round or two next summer. Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	            And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom. Facing that type of talent (and competing against some of the best defenders in Europe) each week will certainly provide Altidore a sharpness that the Dutch Eredivisie couldn\'t offer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                   Fighting to find the back of the net  against the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea is how you get better. After all, would Albert Pujols be better off playing the regular season in Japan before heading to the World Series?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                   You get better by playing better competition. Period.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<img src=\"/images/Klinsmann-happy.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>Added Bonus: </strong>The coach is happy.“We can watch him week in and week out,\" Klinsmann told USsoccer.com. \"We are all excited for Jozy getting into this Premier League season.He will score his goals; I have no doubt about it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Former USMNT</strong> <strong>Weakness is Turning Into a Strength</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                 Given the growing depth of the player pool, the evolution of Altidore has solidified the Americans as threat to any team. That\'s not to say they\'d be favorites against any of the world\'s current top ten, but each time they step onto the pitch, the Yanks can win.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	              In fact, no coach in U.S. history has had as many positive options as Klinsmann will take to the World Cup in Brazil. Now riding a 12 game win streak (the longest ever for an American side), Altidore\'s growing reputation, combined with the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey, has turned the USMNT attack into a global threat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	              As it stands now Klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure, up-tempo, attacking style of soccer. What was once considered at weak spot for the Americans is quickly turning into a strength. Up front,alongside Altidore, the likely roster includes: Dempsey,Donovan, and Eddie Johnson.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	            Add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards - Aron Jóhannsson, Brek Shea, Brad Davis, Chris Wondolowski, Gomez and Terrence Boyd - and the future is looking bright for the American game.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>Did we miss any of your favorite players, or do you have any thoughts on American soccer that you\'d like to share? we\'d love to hear from you.

This resulted in players taking a funny, but uncomfortable, \'perp walk\' through the public sections of the airport.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	         And just to be certain the inconvenience level was high enough, the <a href=\"http://fedefutbolcr.com/\">soccer association</a> deployed a<em style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\"> </em>\'take our balls and go home\' strategy by failing to provide the U.S. with requested game balls for training.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	         Of course, game balls are nice, but a field to kick them on would be nicer. Jurgen Klinsmann\'s crew were forced to find their own practice facility after the three Costa Rican FA recommended sites refused the Stars and Stripes access. The team ended up practicing on a dairy farm.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                  Ultimately the game that caused all the furor was later appealed by the Costa Rican FA and denied by <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/\">FIFA</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                  “That was not our fault,” Klinsmann said Wednesday. “I didn\'t call <a href=\"http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/staff/players/messi/biography\">God</a> to give us some snow.”\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>So that’s the gamesmanship. What about the Game?</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	         The Tico’s get their shot at vengeance in the national stadium  Friday night (10PM EST, beIN Sport). However, with four games remaining, the U.S. leads <a href=\"http://kickrepublic.com/index.php/news/2013/best-goals-in-2013-gold-cup\">CONCACAF</a> qualifying with 13 points. Costa Rica is in second place with 11 points.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	         The Americans come in riding a record-breaking 12-game win streak. With the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley, the team is decidedly more balanced and dynamic than the Ticos.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	         However, taking three points in a CONCACAF Hexagonal matchup in Latin America is never an easy task and, unlike in Denver, this Ticos team will be at full strength.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	         The U.S. has has never won a qualifying match in Costa Rica.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>USMNT Injuries</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	         Jozy Altidore\'s availability remains questionable for the match. Altidore sat out <a href=\"http://www.safc.com/\">Sunderaland\'s last match</a> with a pulled quadricep. And versatile Seattle Sounder midfielder Brad Evans suffered a calf strain last week and is out. This leaves a pretty sizable whole at right back.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>USMNT Questions</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	         Jozy Altidore, Micheal Bradley, Geoff Cameron, Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard, Fabian Johnson, and Jermaine Jones are all carrying cards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	         The U.S. needs to be card careful with a homer against Mexico looming.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>Bottom Line</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    Did we mention the U.S. has has never won a qualifying match in Costa Rica?

After slipping into second place, a point behind the Ticos, the Americans now face a desperate Mexican side that lost at home this weekend to Honduras.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                  And that means the U.S. needs to focus on taking three points at home. Something good teams must do.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                  \"We wanted three points in Costa Rica,\" said coach Jurgen Klinsmann. \"So now we have to find a way to get those three points on Tuesday night.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Down and Dangerous</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	                  Despite heading into Tuesday\'s (8PM, ESPN) qualifier without star striker <a href=\"http://kickrepublic.com/index.php/news/2013/altidore-debut-for-sunderland\">Jozy Altidore </a>and two other starters because of yellow-card suspensions, the U.S. is in far better shape than Mexico, which limps into Ohio Crew Stadium perilously close to missing the <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/index.html\">World Cup</a> for the first time since it was banned from the 1990 tournament for using overage players on a youth national team.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>           El Tri</em> is currently in <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/nccamerica/standings/index.html\">fourth place</a> (1-1-5) among the six teams competing in final-round qualifying. The top  top three finishers earn trips to Brazil, while the fourth-place finisher is forced into playoff with Oceania regional champion New Zealand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                That would be devastating to the Mexican psyche. Even the thought of potentially having to participate in a a pair of play-in games is an embarrassment for the Mexican team. Don\'t think their passionate fans aren\'t irate at the five draws so far this year in CONCACAF play.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                The Mexican Football Association certainly realizes it. They fired fired Coach Jose Manuel \'Chepo\' de la Torres shortly after the Hondorus loss and replaced him with the man who directed the national team to a Gold medal at the London Olympics last year, Luis Fernando Tena.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                \"We have to face this with complete responsibility,\" said Tena, who will be without suspended midfield general Gerardo Torrado. \"We have to prepare ourselves mentally and adapt. The team will maintain the same players and the same fundamentals. In three days, we cannot carry out big changes.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>The American Bottom Line</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	                The loss of Micheal Bradley during warm-ups (ankle) on Friday was a huge blow for the <a href=\"http://www.ussoccer.com/teams/us-men.aspx\">USMNT</a>. And it was obvious from the start of the game that the Americans were disorganized and confused without their field general  controlling the action up top.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <img src=\"/images/Michael_Bradley_Ankle.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	              Bradley is out again against <em>El Tri</em>, but the Stars and Stripes should benefit from a lesson learned hard against Costa Rica. Expect Klimsmann to shuffle some experience  around, possibly slotting Dempsey atop the formation, and dropping potential potent striker Aron \"Bacon\" Jóhannsson into the starting lineup.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>South of the Border </h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	          As for Mexico, ability certainly isn\'t the issue. They have a roster peppered with stars that play in the world\'s top leagues. The coaching shakeup could provide a much needed spark for <em>El Tri\'s</em> lackluster habit of tying and losing this year. A win over the U.S. in Columbus could shuffle the deck, putting Mexico back in the conversation and making them a very dangerous side down the qualifying stretch.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Prediction:</strong> U.S. 2, Mexico, 0\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>   What do you guys think?

As of today the team holds the <a href=\"http://www.concacaf.com/\">5th spot</a> in qualifying, a notch behind Panama and the opportunity to play New Zealand.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<img src=\"/images/mexico-hexagonal.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	              That definitely won\'t sit well with the folks at home.

Near the 15 minute mark, however, a crisp Landon Donovan cross  into the box was sharply headed over the crossbar by Omar Gonzalez. The play seemed to shift the match\'s momentum and the Americans pressed the action throughout the remainder.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                    With Mexico pressuring high up field - a strategy that  initially caused the Yanks some problems - the U.S. was able to consistently counter Mexican miscues.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	           The U.S. dominated the second half. Eddie Johnson punched in a header in the 49th minute, and Landon Donovan slotted a Mix Diskerud pass into the top of the net nearly a half hour later.\r\n</p>\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/2fc7Phg7sec\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\">\r\n</iframe>\r\n<p>\r\n	    The Diskerud play came only two minutes after he was subbed-in for Johnson.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                    Klinsmann is certainly flicking all the right switches.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Time to Get Serious</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	                    Still there is room for improvement in the American locker room. For stretches last night they were disorganized and sloppy as they failed to take advantage of a Mexican side obviously lacking in chemistry.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                    And, once again, the USMNT got off to a slow start and had to be bailed out by superior goaltending. If the Americans make it to the knockout round in Brazil, their opponent won\'t be as forgiving.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                    Despite their struggles against nearly everyone this year, Mexico still managed to look dangerous at times with Gimenez and Dos Santos creating solid attacking opportunities. Early on the American back line failed to challenge the Mexican forwards.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	                    It was a great night for the USMNT. Although the team needs to work on  just about every facet of the game if it wants to make a big splash in Brazil. The good news is the qualifying is over and Klinsmann can play with the lineup in the remaining two games.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                    Grade: A- for America.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	    What are you thoughts?

Because really, that\'s what we are getting these days with Team USA soccer.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Globale Zusammenarbeit</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	    While some men wearing U.S. soccer jerseys these days may not have grown up All-Americans, certain members of the USMNT born abroad are quickly finding a nice little home among the American sporting public.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<img src=\"/images/German_USA.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	  Call it Das Deutsch Einfluss!\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	  And its starts with the coach, Jürgen Klinsmann, whose footballing style is beginning to take root on the American game. Toss in a few German born starters for Team USA to nicely suppliment the American mainstays and you\'ve got a cohesive group that has won 12 of its last 13 games.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	  Klinsmann once again pressed all the right levers against Mexico, including another timely sub (Mix Diskerud) that directly impacted a goal within two minutes on the pitch.\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>Chopping Down <em>El Tri</em></h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	          Taking down <em>El Tri</em> on U.S. soil is becoming expected, but sometimes the players rising to the occasion are unexpected. Here\'s how the U.S. did it this time.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	           And remember, the ratings (on a scale of 1, diabolical; to 10, world class):\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>  Tim Howard:</strong> After buckling under some early Mexican pressure, the American back line was able to pull itself together. However, without Tim Howard in goal, El  Tri (Giovanni Dos Santos, 43rd minute, and on Diego Reyes, 45th) may have put one, possibly two on the board. Despite his advancing age (36), and backup that is often lightsout for Aston Villa, expect Klinsmann to keep this superman in net at least through Brazil World Cup 2014. 8 Übermensch.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>  Fabian Johnson:</strong> You\'d expect a German to be an ubermensh on the pitch, but Fabian Johnson looked absolutely Canadian at times against Mexico. On several occasions he was lost on defense and never achieved any forward flowing momentum. He was yanked in the BLANK minute with a tight hammy.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>  Why we need to cut him some slack: </strong>It was only his second time with the U.S team at right back. His performance was reminiscent of the Canadian summer, lukewarm and buggy. A lukewarm Canadian summer ranking of 5.0.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>  Clarence Goodson: </strong>What\'s the clearance, Clarence? He set the bar pretty high with a very respectable performance against the Mexicans, especially considering he was essentially a last minute injury replacement. He shut down the Mexican attack for much of the game after the first 15 minutes. Colonel Klinsmann will be penciling him in for Brazil. Get your USMNT # 21 jerseys while the aren\'t hot. 7.5\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>Jermaine Jones: </strong>Another German-Connection (it\'d be so much better for the editorial department if half the team was French instead of German) the GERMAN TEAM forward patrolled the midfield with (german or french) with carte blanche (see?). On botht he defensive and offensive end Jones was always in control. A very German national team 8 Übermensches for the former German (school boy or national)\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>  Kyle Beckerman:</strong> In the \"we don\'t give awards for trying\" department, Beckerman had the unenviable role of filling in for perhaps the most important playa on the American national team. And he did more than try. He gave Klinsman a solid performance, forcing several turnovers and, most importantly, allowed the play makers to do their jobs. Beckerman is one pretty darn good reason the U.S. held a decided possession advantage. Give that boy a 7.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>  Alejadro Bedoya: </strong>It\'s not easy the first time out of the gate but Bedoya gave a solid perfromance considering the pressure that comes with a World Cup qualifying premiere. And it against a regional nemesis. Ranking 6.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>Omar Gonzalez: </strong>Similar to Goodson, Gonzalez put forth an impressive effort to all but ensure he will be on the U.S team at next year’s World Cup. Gonzalez was sharp breaking up attacks and won most 50/50 balls in his area. Rating: 7.5\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>  Clint Dempsey:</strong> Clint is spending too much time thinking about his MLS record paying transfer, or maybe his rap career. There were times I forgot he was playing, for real. And shanking a free kick in stoppage time with a 2-0 lead and absolutley zero pressure? He wasn\'t giving it his all, Captian! An aboslutely Canadian (Just like Scotty was) rating of 4.5.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>Eddie Johnson:</strong> We get it: Eddie Johnson is awesome up in the air. So why don\'t otehr teams get it? Maybe they do, but can do nothing to stop him. Either way, the Donovan to Johnson set play makes the USMNT dangers to any team in the world. Rating: 7.5\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>  Landon Donovan:</strong> He really is the best American player ever. He\'s motoro is always going and he seems to have the same leg drive and speed in the 90th minute as he does in the 5th. Watch him chase down balls heading out of bounds late in teh game. Donavan is nonstop power. Another day at the office for Donavan: one assist, one goal. He\'s so good I doubt he\'s ever been to Canada. He probably can\'t even spell it.

One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie<\\/em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fifa.com\\/worldcup\\/news\\/index.html\\\">2014 FIFA World Cup <\\/a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \\\"Jozy: 2010\\\".\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t            Let\\u2019s address the \\u2018conventional wisdom\\u2019 of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t     The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:<\\/strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Added Bonus: <\\/strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p style=\\\"margin-left: 20px;\\\">\\r\\n\\t<span style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\"> 2.

Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<span style=\\\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\\\">And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom.

One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie<\\/em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fifa.com\\/worldcup\\/news\\/index.html\\\">2014 FIFA World Cup <\\/a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \\\"Jozy: 2010\\\".\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                 Let\\u2019s address the \\u2018conventional wisdom\\u2019 of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:<\\/strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <strong>Added Bonus: <\\/strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    2. The rough and tumble Prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time Brazil 2014 rolls around.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t       At 6\'1 and 200+ pounds Altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he\'s recently displayed if the United States hope to advance a round or two next summer. Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom. Facing that type of talent (and competing against some of the best defenders in Europe) each week will certainly provide Altidore a sharpness that the Dutch Eredivisie couldn\'t offer.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          Fighting to find the back of the net  against the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea is how you get better. After all, would Albert Pujols be better off playing the regular season in Japan before heading to the World Series?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          You get better by playing better competition.

That\'s not to say they\'d be favorites against any of the world\'s current top ten, but each time they step onto the pitch, the Yanks can win.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t     In fact, no coach in U.S. history has had as many positive options as Klinsmann will take to the World Cup in Brazil. Now riding a 12 game win streak (the longest ever for an American side), Altidore\'s growing reputation, combined with the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey, has turned the USMNT attack into a global threat.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t     As it stands now Klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure, up-tempo, attacking style of soccer. What was once considered at weak spot for the Americans is quickly turning into a strength. Up front,alongside Altidore, the likely roster includes: Dempsey,Donovan, and Eddie Johnson.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   Add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards - Aron J\\u00f3hannsson, Brek Shea, Brad Davis, Chris Wondolowski, Gomez and Terrence Boyd - and the future is looking bright for the American game.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <em>Did we miss any of your favorite players, or do you have any thoughts on American soccer that you\'d like to share? we\'d love to hear from you.

One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie<\\/em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fifa.com\\/worldcup\\/news\\/index.html\\\">2014 FIFA World Cup <\\/a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \\\"Jozy: 2010\\\".\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                  Let\\u2019s address the \\u2018conventional wisdom\\u2019 of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t           The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:<\\/strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Added Bonus: <\\/strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t     2. The rough and tumble Prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time Brazil 2014 rolls around.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t        At 6\'1 and 200+ pounds Altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he\'s recently displayed if the United States hope to advance a round or two next summer. Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom. Facing that type of talent (and competing against some of the best defenders in Europe) each week will certainly provide Altidore a sharpness that the Dutch Eredivisie couldn\'t offer.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t           Fighting to find the back of the net  against the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea is how you get better. After all, would Albert Pujols be better off playing the regular season in Japan before heading to the World Series?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t           You get better by playing better competition.

That\'s not to say they\'d be favorites against any of the world\'s current top ten, but each time they step onto the pitch, the Yanks can win.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t      In fact, no coach in U.S. history has had as many positive options as Klinsmann will take to the World Cup in Brazil. Now riding a 12 game win streak (the longest ever for an American side), Altidore\'s growing reputation, combined with the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey, has turned the USMNT attack into a global threat.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t      As it stands now Klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure, up-tempo, attacking style of soccer. What was once considered at weak spot for the Americans is quickly turning into a strength. Up front,alongside Altidore, the likely roster includes: Dempsey,Donovan, and Eddie Johnson.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    Add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards - Aron J\\u00f3hannsson, Brek Shea, Brad Davis, Chris Wondolowski, Gomez and Terrence Boyd - and the future is looking bright for the American game.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<em>Did we miss any of your favorite players, or do you have any thoughts on American soccer that you\'d like to share? we\'d love to hear from you.

One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie<\\/em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fifa.com\\/worldcup\\/news\\/index.html\\\">2014 FIFA World Cup <\\/a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \\\"Jozy: 2010\\\".\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                   Let\\u2019s address the \\u2018conventional wisdom\\u2019 of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t            The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:<\\/strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <strong>Added Bonus: <\\/strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t      2. The rough and tumble Prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time Brazil 2014 rolls around.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t         At 6\'1 and 200+ pounds Altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he\'s recently displayed if the United States hope to advance a round or two next summer. Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t     And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom. Facing that type of talent (and competing against some of the best defenders in Europe) each week will certainly provide Altidore a sharpness that the Dutch Eredivisie couldn\'t offer.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t            Fighting to find the back of the net  against the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea is how you get better. After all, would Albert Pujols be better off playing the regular season in Japan before heading to the World Series?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t            You get better by playing better competition.

That\'s not to say they\'d be favorites against any of the world\'s current top ten, but each time they step onto the pitch, the Yanks can win.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t       In fact, no coach in U.S. history has had as many positive options as Klinsmann will take to the World Cup in Brazil. Now riding a 12 game win streak (the longest ever for an American side), Altidore\'s growing reputation, combined with the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey, has turned the USMNT attack into a global threat.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t       As it stands now Klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure, up-tempo, attacking style of soccer. What was once considered at weak spot for the Americans is quickly turning into a strength. Up front,alongside Altidore, the likely roster includes: Dempsey,Donovan, and Eddie Johnson.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t     Add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards - Aron J\\u00f3hannsson, Brek Shea, Brad Davis, Chris Wondolowski, Gomez and Terrence Boyd - and the future is looking bright for the American game.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <em>Did we miss any of your favorite players, or do you have any thoughts on American soccer that you\'d like to share? we\'d love to hear from you.

One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie<\\/em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fifa.com\\/worldcup\\/news\\/index.html\\\">2014 FIFA World Cup <\\/a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \\\"Jozy: 2010\\\".\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                      Let\\u2019s address the \\u2018conventional wisdom\\u2019 of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t               The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:<\\/strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Added Bonus: <\\/strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t         2. The rough and tumble Prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time Brazil 2014 rolls around.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t            At 6\'1 and 200+ pounds Altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he\'s recently displayed if the United States hope to advance a round or two next summer. Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t        And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom. Facing that type of talent (and competing against some of the best defenders in Europe) each week will certainly provide Altidore a sharpness that the Dutch Eredivisie couldn\'t offer.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t               Fighting to find the back of the net  against the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea is how you get better. After all, would Albert Pujols be better off playing the regular season in Japan before heading to the World Series?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t               You get better by playing better competition.

That\'s not to say they\'d be favorites against any of the world\'s current top ten, but each time they step onto the pitch, the Yanks can win.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          In fact, no coach in U.S. history has had as many positive options as Klinsmann will take to the World Cup in Brazil. Now riding a 12 game win streak (the longest ever for an American side), Altidore\'s growing reputation, combined with the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey, has turned the USMNT attack into a global threat.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          As it stands now Klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure, up-tempo, attacking style of soccer. What was once considered at weak spot for the Americans is quickly turning into a strength. Up front,alongside Altidore, the likely roster includes: Dempsey,Donovan, and Eddie Johnson.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t        Add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards - Aron J\\u00f3hannsson, Brek Shea, Brad Davis, Chris Wondolowski, Gomez and Terrence Boyd - and the future is looking bright for the American game.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<em>Did we miss any of your favorite players, or do you have any thoughts on American soccer that you\'d like to share? we\'d love to hear from you.

One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie<\\/em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fifa.com\\/worldcup\\/news\\/index.html\\\">2014 FIFA World Cup <\\/a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \\\"Jozy: 2010\\\".\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                       Let\\u2019s address the \\u2018conventional wisdom\\u2019 of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:<\\/strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <strong>Added Bonus: <\\/strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          2. The rough and tumble Prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time Brazil 2014 rolls around.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t             At 6\'1 and 200+ pounds Altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he\'s recently displayed if the United States hope to advance a round or two next summer. Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t         And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom. Facing that type of talent (and competing against some of the best defenders in Europe) each week will certainly provide Altidore a sharpness that the Dutch Eredivisie couldn\'t offer.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                Fighting to find the back of the net  against the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea is how you get better. After all, would Albert Pujols be better off playing the regular season in Japan before heading to the World Series?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                You get better by playing better competition.

That\'s not to say they\'d be favorites against any of the world\'s current top ten, but each time they step onto the pitch, the Yanks can win.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t           In fact, no coach in U.S. history has had as many positive options as Klinsmann will take to the World Cup in Brazil. Now riding a 12 game win streak (the longest ever for an American side), Altidore\'s growing reputation, combined with the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey, has turned the USMNT attack into a global threat.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t           As it stands now Klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure, up-tempo, attacking style of soccer. What was once considered at weak spot for the Americans is quickly turning into a strength. Up front,alongside Altidore, the likely roster includes: Dempsey,Donovan, and Eddie Johnson.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t         Add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards - Aron J\\u00f3hannsson, Brek Shea, Brad Davis, Chris Wondolowski, Gomez and Terrence Boyd - and the future is looking bright for the American game.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <em>Did we miss any of your favorite players, or do you have any thoughts on American soccer that you\'d like to share? we\'d love to hear from you.

The play seemed to shift the match\'s momentum and the Americans pressed the action throughout the remainder.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                   With Mexico pressuring high up field - a strategy that  initially caused the Yanks some problems - the U.S. was able to consistently counter Mexican miscues.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          The U.S. dominated the second half. Eddie Johnson punched in a header in the 49th minute, and Landon Donovan slotted a Mix Diskerud pass into the top of the net nearly a half hour later.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<iframe width=\\\"420\\\" height=\\\"315\\\" src=\\\"\\/\\/www.youtube.com\\/embed\\/2fc7Phg7sec\\\" frameborder=\\\"0\\\" allowfullscreen=\\\"\\\">\\r\\n<\\/iframe>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   The Diskerud play came only two minutes after he was subbed-in for Johnson.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                   Klinsmann is certainly flicking all the right switches.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>Time to Get Serious<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                   Still there is room for improvement in the American locker room. For stretches last night they were disorganized and sloppy as they failed to take advantage of a Mexican side obviously lacking in chemistry.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                   And, once again, the USMNT got off to a slow start and had to be bailed out by superior goaltending. If the Americans make it to the knockout round in Brazil, their opponent won\'t be as forgiving.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                   Despite their struggles against nearly everyone this year, Mexico still managed to look dangerous at times with Gimenez and Dos Santos creating solid attacking opportunities. Early on the American back line failed to challenge the Mexican forwards.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<h2>The Bottom Line<\\/h2>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                   It was a great night for the USMNT. Although the team needs to work on  just about every facet of the game if it wants to make a big splash in Brazil. The good news is the qualifying is over and Klinsmann can play with the lineup in the remaining two games.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                   Grade: A- for America.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   What are you thoughts?

least to american ears of sir ian s call it s a safe bet jozy altidore has been on the receiving end of such praise more than ever this past year after scoring a career high 31 goals in the 2012 2013 season for dutch side az alkmaar the american national this summer scored in four straight matches for the u s men s national team and in case that hadn t proved to the soccer world that the one time teenage prodigy was finally delivering on his potential altidore then powered the usmnt to a 4 3 victory over no 13 ranked bosnia herzegovina with a hat trick in sarajevo ready to tear up the premiere now he is flashing the red and white stripes of sunderland afc in a return trip to the barclays premiere league and on tuesday altidore made team management look sharp scoring his first goal for the black cats and and setting up the winner in a 4 2 victory over third level milton keynes dons in the english league cup the former soccer phenom has come a long way since one prem coach told the media the 6 1 striker had no idea what he was doing on the pitch and didn t understand tactics at all i am almost a completely different player now said altidore recently referring to his last league campaign with hull city and certainly a better and more experienced one the numbers back him up consider this he set a record for americans abroad with 31 goals in all competitions surpassing seattle sounder clint dempsey altidore helped az win the dutch cup he ended a woeful scoring drought with usmnt with goals in four straight mathces including this sumptuous volley against germany below the black cats will be counting on the new jersey native to provide some much needed finishing touches up the team slogged through a poor campaign last season that ended in a relegation fight with wigan and aston villa altidore is one of the top strikers in europe sunderland boss di canio told the club s official website i m very happy curious and excited because i have a very good attacking side at the moment i m really pleased because a new arrival can benefit the squad and also individuals because there is competition up front that competition now also includes the late acquisition of juventus playmaker emanuele giaccherini which should certainly offer altidore top level service and creativity what does this mean for the american soccer it seems the american soccer sporting press is split one camp let s call them soccer s bloggeratie yes i said it and it s now mine suggests altidore was in a such a groove with az that any disruption so close to 2014 fifa world cup can only stunt his recent development plus this line of thought continues sunderland doesn t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to altidore s strengths add to the mix the rough physical play the league is known for and you ve got a fantastic recipe for creating jozy 2010 let s address the conventional wisdom of each and i ll tell you why kick republic disagrees the black cats don t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to altidore s strengths this is a major disadvantage to his growth at sunderland altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4 4 2 formation alongside steven fletcher and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities from quality wingers sebastian larsson stephane sessegnon and the diminutive speedster giaccherini although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of az or the usmnt di canio promises to play attacking football the move should help develop altidore s overall game as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that u s boss jurgen klinsmann may require note in the second half against bosnia klinsmann moved eddie johnson up top with altidore while fabian johnson slid into the left wing position with jermaine jones free to operate in the hole the attacking strategy created a 4 4 2 as well as three goals added bonus di canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day he should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23 year old altidore continue his development 2 the rough and tumble prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time brazil 2014 rolls around at 6 1 and 200 pounds altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he s recently displayed if the united states hope to advance a round or two next summer imagine a crafty large man brazil s hulk anyone teamed with dempsey donovan and bradley creating havoc in opposing teams backfields and despite the recent success of spain s la liga and germany s bundesliga against the world s best the barclays english premier league provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom facing that type of talent and competing against some of the best defenders in europe each week will certainly provide altidore a sharpness that the dutch eredivisie couldn t offer fighting to find the back of the net against the likes of manchester united manchester city and chelsea is how you get better after all would albert pujols be better off playing the regular season in japan before heading to the world series you get better by playing better competition period added bonus the coach is happy we can watch him week in and week out klinsmann told ussoccer com we are all excited for jozy getting into this premier league season he will score his goals i have no doubt about it former usmnt weakness is turning into a strength given the growing depth of the player pool the evolution of altidore has solidified the americans as threat to any team that s not to say they d be favorites against any of the world s current top ten but each time they step onto the pitch the yanks can win in fact no coach in u s history has had as many positive options as klinsmann will take to the world cup in brazil now riding a 12 game win streak the longest ever for an american side altidore s growing reputation combined with the resurgence of landon donovan and the steady if not stellar presence of clint dempsey has turned the usmnt attack into a global threat as it stands now klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure up tempo attacking style of soccer what was once considered at weak spot for the americans is quickly turning into a strength up front alongside altidore the likely roster includes dempsey donovan and eddie johnson add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards aron johannsson brek shea brad davis chris wondolowski gomez and terrence boyd and the future is looking bright for the american game did
