After scoring a career-high 31 goals in the 2012-2013 season for Dutch side AZ Alkmaar, the American national this summer scored in four straight matches for the <a href=\"http://www.ussoccer.com/teams/us-men.aspx\">U.S. Men\'s National Team</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                         And in case that hadn\'t proved to the soccer world that the one-time teenage prodigy was finally delivering on his potential, Altidore then powered the USMNT to a 4-3 victory over No. 13-ranked Bosnia-Herzegovina with a hat trick in Sarajevo.\r\n</p>\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/0kZH8EKoMWc\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\">\r\n</iframe>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Ready to Tear Up The Premiere? </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                      Now he is flashing the red-and-white stripes  of <a href=\"http://www.safc.com/\">Sunderland AFC</a> in a return trip to the Barclays Premiere League, and on Tuesday Altidore made team management look sharp, scoring his first goal for the Black Cats and and setting up the winner in a 4-2 victory over third-level Milton Keynes Dons in the English League Cup.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                                The former soccer phenom has come a long way since one Prem coach told the media the 6\'1 striker \"had no idea what he was doing\" on the pitch and \"didn\'t understand tactics at all.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                   “I am almost a completely different player now,\" said Altidore recently, referring to his last league campaign with Hull City. \"And certainly a better and more experienced one.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>The Numbers Back Him Up </strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                                          Consider this:\r\n</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>He set a record for Americans abroad with 31 goals in all competitions (surpassing  Seattle Sounder Clint Dempsey).</li>\r\n	<li>Altidore helped AZ win the Dutch Cup.</li>\r\n	<li>He ended a woeful scoring drought with USMNT with goals in four straight mathces, including this “sumptuous volley” against Germany (below).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/S7yn7LSufUE\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\">\r\n</iframe>\r\n<p>\r\n	                                         The Black Cats will be counting on the New Jersey native to provide some much needed finishing touches up the team slogged through a poor campaign last season that ended in a relegation fight with Wigan and Aston Villa.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                                         \"Altidore is one of the top strikers in Europe,” Sunderland boss Di Canio told the club\'s official website. “I\'m very happy, curious and excited because I have a very good attacking side at the moment. I\'m really pleased because a new arrival can benefit the squad and also individuals because there is competition up front.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                              That competition now also includes the late <a href=\"http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11695/8819130/transfer-news-juventus-to-sell-sunderland-target-emanuele-giaccherini\">acquisition of Juventus playmaker</a> Emanuele Giaccherini, which should certainly offer Altidore top level service and creativity.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>What Does This Mean for the American Soccer?</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                                         It seems the American soccer sporting press is split. One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie</em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/index.html\">2014 FIFA World Cup </a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore’s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \"Jozy: 2010\".\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                          Let’s address the ‘conventional wisdom’ of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\r\n</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore’s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\r\n<p>\r\n	                   The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:</strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Added Bonus: </strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	             2. The rough and tumble Prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time Brazil 2014 rolls around.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                At 6\'1 and 200+ pounds Altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he\'s recently displayed if the United States hope to advance a round or two next summer. Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	            And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom. Facing that type of talent (and competing against some of the best defenders in Europe) each week will certainly provide Altidore a sharpness that the Dutch Eredivisie couldn\'t offer.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                   Fighting to find the back of the net  against the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea is how you get better. After all, would Albert Pujols be better off playing the regular season in Japan before heading to the World Series?\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                   You get better by playing better competition. Period.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<img src=\"/images/Klinsmann-happy.jpg\">\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	 <strong>Added Bonus: </strong>The coach is happy.“We can watch him week in and week out,\" Klinsmann told USsoccer.com. \"We are all excited for Jozy getting into this Premier League season.He will score his goals; I have no doubt about it.\"\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Former USMNT</strong> <strong>Weakness is Turning Into a Strength</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                 Given the growing depth of the player pool, the evolution of Altidore has solidified the Americans as threat to any team. That\'s not to say they\'d be favorites against any of the world\'s current top ten, but each time they step onto the pitch, the Yanks can win.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	              In fact, no coach in U.S. history has had as many positive options as Klinsmann will take to the World Cup in Brazil. Now riding a 12 game win streak (the longest ever for an American side), Altidore\'s growing reputation, combined with the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey, has turned the USMNT attack into a global threat.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	              As it stands now Klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure, up-tempo, attacking style of soccer. What was once considered at weak spot for the Americans is quickly turning into a strength. Up front,alongside Altidore, the likely roster includes: Dempsey,Donovan, and Eddie Johnson.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	            Add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards - Aron Jóhannsson, Brek Shea, Brad Davis, Chris Wondolowski, Gomez and Terrence Boyd - and the future is looking bright for the American game.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<em>Did we miss any of your favorite players, or do you have any thoughts on American soccer that you\'d like to share? we\'d love to hear from you.

Still steamed over a 1-0 loss to the Americans amid a freakish March snowstorm in Denver, hundreds of locals turned up at Juan Santamaría International Airport to wish the Americans well by tossing eggs at the team bus and chanting \"USA, no fair play!\"\r\n</p>\r\n<iframe width=\"420\" height=\"315\" src=\"//www.youtube.com/embed/DWVVP4UsW-g\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\">\r\n</iframe>\r\n<p>\r\n	               And it’s not just local Ticos fans that are fuming over that World Cup qualifying loss.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	It started with President Laura Chinchilla Miranda who took the unusual, and not very diplomatic, step of announcing the Americans would be denied standard priority immigration status offered to most<em style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\"> </em>visiting teams. This resulted in players taking a funny, but uncomfortable, \'perp walk\' through the public sections of the airport.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	        And just to be certain the inconvenience level was high enough, the <a href=\"http://fedefutbolcr.com/\">soccer association</a> deployed a<em style=\"font-family: Arial, Helvetica, Verdana, Tahoma, sans-serif;\"> </em>\'take our balls and go home\' strategy by failing to provide the U.S. with requested game balls for training.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	        Of course, game balls are nice, but a field to kick them on would be nicer. Jurgen Klinsmann\'s crew were forced to find their own practice facility after the three Costa Rican FA recommended sites refused the Stars and Stripes access. The team ended up practicing on a dairy farm.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                 Ultimately the game that caused all the furor was later appealed by the Costa Rican FA and denied by <a href=\"http://www.fifa.com/\">FIFA</a>.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	                 “That was not our fault,” Klinsmann said Wednesday. “I didn\'t call <a href=\"http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/staff/players/messi/biography\">God</a> to give us some snow.”\r\n</p>\r\n<h2>So that’s the gamesmanship. What about the Game?</h2>\r\n<p>\r\n	        The Tico’s get their shot at vengeance in the national stadium  Friday night (10PM EST, beIN Sport). However, with four games remaining, the U.S. leads <a href=\"http://kickrepublic.com/index.php/news/2013/best-goals-in-2013-gold-cup\">CONCACAF</a> qualifying with 13 points. Costa Rica is in second place with 11 points.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	        The Americans come in riding a record-breaking 12-game win streak. With the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey and Michael Bradley, the team is decidedly more balanced and dynamic than the Ticos.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	        However, taking three points in a CONCACAF Hexagonal matchup in Latin America is never an easy task and, unlike in Denver, this Ticos team will be at full strength.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	        The U.S. has has never won a qualifying match in Costa Rica.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>USMNT Injuries</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	        Jozy Altidore\'s availability remains questionable for the match. Altidore sat out <a href=\"http://www.safc.com/\">Sunderaland\'s last match</a> with a pulled quadricep. And versatile Seattle Sounder midfielder Brad Evans suffered a calf strain last week and is out. This leaves a pretty sizable whole at right back.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>USMNT Questions</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	        Jozy Altidore, Micheal Bradley, Geoff Cameron, Clint Dempsey, Tim Howard, Fabian Johnson, and Jermaine Jones are all carrying cards.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	        The U.S. needs to be card careful with a homer against Mexico looming.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	<strong>Bottom Line</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	   Did we mention the U.S. has has never won a qualifying match in Costa Rica? And it most likely won\'t move the win streak to 13 on Friday.Expect a chippy, physical set with both teams pushing for three.\r\n</p>\r\n<p>\r\n	  In the end, the Americans win: 1-1.

One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie<\\/em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fifa.com\\/worldcup\\/news\\/index.html\\\">2014 FIFA World Cup <\\/a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \\\"Jozy: 2010\\\".\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                 Let\\u2019s address the \\u2018conventional wisdom\\u2019 of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:<\\/strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <strong>Added Bonus: <\\/strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    2. The rough and tumble Prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time Brazil 2014 rolls around.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t       At 6\'1 and 200+ pounds Altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he\'s recently displayed if the United States hope to advance a round or two next summer. Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom. Facing that type of talent (and competing against some of the best defenders in Europe) each week will certainly provide Altidore a sharpness that the Dutch Eredivisie couldn\'t offer.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          Fighting to find the back of the net  against the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea is how you get better. After all, would Albert Pujols be better off playing the regular season in Japan before heading to the World Series?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          You get better by playing better competition.

That\'s not to say they\'d be favorites against any of the world\'s current top ten, but each time they step onto the pitch, the Yanks can win.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t     In fact, no coach in U.S. history has had as many positive options as Klinsmann will take to the World Cup in Brazil. Now riding a 12 game win streak (the longest ever for an American side), Altidore\'s growing reputation, combined with the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey, has turned the USMNT attack into a global threat.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t     As it stands now Klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure, up-tempo, attacking style of soccer. What was once considered at weak spot for the Americans is quickly turning into a strength. Up front,alongside Altidore, the likely roster includes: Dempsey,Donovan, and Eddie Johnson.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t   Add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards - Aron J\\u00f3hannsson, Brek Shea, Brad Davis, Chris Wondolowski, Gomez and Terrence Boyd - and the future is looking bright for the American game.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <em>Did we miss any of your favorite players, or do you have any thoughts on American soccer that you\'d like to share? we\'d love to hear from you.

One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie<\\/em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fifa.com\\/worldcup\\/news\\/index.html\\\">2014 FIFA World Cup <\\/a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \\\"Jozy: 2010\\\".\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                  Let\\u2019s address the \\u2018conventional wisdom\\u2019 of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t           The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:<\\/strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Added Bonus: <\\/strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t     2. The rough and tumble Prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time Brazil 2014 rolls around.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t        At 6\'1 and 200+ pounds Altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he\'s recently displayed if the United States hope to advance a round or two next summer. Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom. Facing that type of talent (and competing against some of the best defenders in Europe) each week will certainly provide Altidore a sharpness that the Dutch Eredivisie couldn\'t offer.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t           Fighting to find the back of the net  against the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea is how you get better. After all, would Albert Pujols be better off playing the regular season in Japan before heading to the World Series?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t           You get better by playing better competition. Period.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<img src=\\\"\\/images\\/Klinsmann-happy.jpg\\\">\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <strong>Added Bonus: <\\/strong>The coach is happy.\\u201cWe can watch him week in and week out,\\\" Klinsmann told USsoccer.com. \\\"We are all excited for Jozy getting into this Premier League season.He will score his goals; I have no doubt about it.\\\"\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<strong>Former USMNT<\\/strong> <strong>Weakness is Turning Into a Strength<\\/strong>\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t         Given the growing depth of the player pool, the evolution of Altidore has solidified the Americans as threat to any team. That\'s not to say they\'d be favorites against any of the world\'s current top ten, but each time they step onto the pitch, the Yanks can win.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t      In fact, no coach in U.S. history has had as many positive options as Klinsmann will take to the World Cup in Brazil. Now riding a 12 game win streak (the longest ever for an American side), Altidore\'s growing reputation, combined with the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey, has turned the USMNT attack into a global threat.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t      As it stands now Klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure, up-tempo, attacking style of soccer. What was once considered at weak spot for the Americans is quickly turning into a strength. Up front,alongside Altidore, the likely roster includes: Dempsey,Donovan, and Eddie Johnson.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t    Add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards - Aron J\\u00f3hannsson, Brek Shea, Brad Davis, Chris Wondolowski, Gomez and Terrence Boyd - and the future is looking bright for the American game.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t<em>Did we miss any of your favorite players, or do you have any thoughts on American soccer that you\'d like to share? we\'d love to hear from you.

One camp, let\'s call them  soccer\'s <em>Bloggeratie<\\/em> (yes, I said it and it\'s now mine!), suggests Altidore was in a such a groove with AZ that any disruption so close to <a href=\\\"http:\\/\\/www.fifa.com\\/worldcup\\/news\\/index.html\\\">2014 FIFA World Cup <\\/a>can only stunt his recent development. Plus, this line of thought continues, Sunderland doesn\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. Add to the mix the rough, physical play the league is known for and you\'ve got a fantastic recipe for creating \\\"Jozy: 2010\\\".\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                       Let\\u2019s address the \\u2018conventional wisdom\\u2019 of each and I\'ll tell you why Kick Republic disagrees.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>The Black Cats don\'t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to Altidore\\u2019s strengths. This is a major disadvantage to his growth.<\\/li>\\r\\n<\\/ol>\\r\\n    At Sunderland, Altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4-4-2 formation alongside Steven Fletcher, and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities  from quality  wingers Sebastian Larsson, *Stephane Sessegnon and the diminutive speedster Giaccherini.Although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of AZ or the USMNT, Di Canio promises to play attacking football.\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                The move should help develop Altidore\'s overall game, as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that U.S. boss Jurgen Klinsmann may require. <strong>Note:<\\/strong> In the second half against Bosnia, Klinsmann moved Eddie Johnson up top with Altidore, while Fabian Johnson slid into the left wing position. With Jermaine Jones free to operate in the hole, the attacking strategy created a 4-4-2 as well as three goals.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <strong>Added Bonus: <\\/strong>Di Canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day. He should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23-year-old Altidore continue his development.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t          2. The rough and tumble Prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time Brazil 2014 rolls around.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t             At 6\'1 and 200+ pounds Altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he\'s recently displayed if the United States hope to advance a round or two next summer. Imagine a crafty, large man (Brazil\'s Hulk, anyone?) teamed with Dempsey, Donovan and Bradley creating havoc in opposing teams\' backfields?\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t         And despite the recent success of  Spain\'s La Liga and Germany\'s Bundesliga against the world\'s best, the Barclays English Premier League provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom. Facing that type of talent (and competing against some of the best defenders in Europe) each week will certainly provide Altidore a sharpness that the Dutch Eredivisie couldn\'t offer.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t                Fighting to find the back of the net  against the likes of Manchester United, Manchester City, and Chelsea is how you get better.

That\'s not to say they\'d be favorites against any of the world\'s current top ten, but each time they step onto the pitch, the Yanks can win.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t           In fact, no coach in U.S. history has had as many positive options as Klinsmann will take to the World Cup in Brazil. Now riding a 12 game win streak (the longest ever for an American side), Altidore\'s growing reputation, combined with the resurgence of Landon Donovan and the steady, if not stellar, presence of Clint Dempsey, has turned the USMNT attack into a global threat.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t           As it stands now Klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure, up-tempo, attacking style of soccer. What was once considered at weak spot for the Americans is quickly turning into a strength. Up front,alongside Altidore, the likely roster includes: Dempsey,Donovan, and Eddie Johnson.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t         Add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards - Aron J\\u00f3hannsson, Brek Shea, Brad Davis, Chris Wondolowski, Gomez and Terrence Boyd - and the future is looking bright for the American game.\\r\\n<\\/p>\\r\\n<p>\\r\\n\\t <em>Did we miss any of your favorite players, or do you have any thoughts on American soccer that you\'d like to share? we\'d love to hear from you.

volley ian darke on jozy altidore s goal against germany despite the somewhat unorthodox phrasing at least to american ears of sir ian s call it s a safe bet jozy altidore has been on the receiving end of such praise more than ever this past year after scoring a career high 31 goals in the 2012 2013 season for dutch side az alkmaar the american national this summer scored in four straight matches for the u s men s national team and in case that hadn t proved to the soccer world that the one time teenage prodigy was finally delivering on his potential altidore then powered the usmnt to a 4 3 victory over no 13 ranked bosnia herzegovina with a hat trick in sarajevo ready to tear up the premiere now he is flashing the red and white stripes of sunderland afc in a return trip to the barclays premiere league and on tuesday altidore made team management look sharp scoring his first goal for the black cats and and setting up the winner in a 4 2 victory over third level milton keynes dons in the english league cup the former soccer phenom has come a long way since one prem coach told the media the 6 1 striker had no idea what he was doing on the pitch and didn t understand tactics at all i am almost a completely different player now said altidore recently referring to his last league campaign with hull city and certainly a better and more experienced one the numbers back him up consider this he set a record for americans abroad with 31 goals in all competitions surpassing seattle sounder clint dempsey altidore helped az win the dutch cup he ended a woeful scoring drought with usmnt with goals in four straight mathces including this sumptuous volley against germany below the black cats will be counting on the new jersey native to provide some much needed finishing touches up the team slogged through a poor campaign last season that ended in a relegation fight with wigan and aston villa altidore is one of the top strikers in europe sunderland boss di canio told the club s official website i m very happy curious and excited because i have a very good attacking side at the moment i m really pleased because a new arrival can benefit the squad and also individuals because there is competition up front that competition now also includes the late acquisition of juventus playmaker emanuele giaccherini which should certainly offer altidore top level service and creativity what does this mean for the american soccer it seems the american soccer sporting press is split one camp let s call them soccer s bloggeratie yes i said it and it s now mine suggests altidore was in a such a groove with az that any disruption so close to 2014 fifa world cup can only stunt his recent development plus this line of thought continues sunderland doesn t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to altidore s strengths add to the mix the rough physical play the league is known for and you ve got a fantastic recipe for creating jozy 2010 let s address the conventional wisdom of each and i ll tell you why kick republic disagrees the black cats don t play the style of soccer that is beneficial to altidore s strengths this is a major disadvantage to his growth at sunderland altidore finds himself up front in a traditional 4 4 2 formation alongside steven fletcher and should be on the receiving end of many opportunities from quality wingers sebastian larsson stephane sessegnon and the diminutive speedster giaccherini although the formation will likely lack the the familiar flow of az or the usmnt di canio promises to play attacking football the move should help develop altidore s overall game as well as prepare him to play in a variety of situations and styles that u s boss jurgen klinsmann may require note in the second half against bosnia klinsmann moved eddie johnson up top with altidore while fabian johnson slid into the left wing position with jermaine jones free to operate in the hole the attacking strategy created a 4 4 2 as well as three goals added bonus di canio was an incredibly talented and crafty striker in his day he should be able to impart some of his craftsmanship and experience to help the 23 year old altidore continue his development 2 the rough and tumble prem will not only hurt his style but hurt his body by the time brazil 2014 rolls around at 6 1 and 200 pounds altidore should be cultivating a more physical style to go with the touch he s recently displayed if the united states hope to advance a round or two next summer imagine a crafty large man brazil s hulk anyone teamed with dempsey donovan and bradley creating havoc in opposing teams backfields and despite the recent success of spain s la liga and germany s bundesliga against the world s best the barclays english premier league provides the ultimate level of competition from top to bottom facing that type of talent and competing against some of the best defenders in europe each week will certainly provide altidore a sharpness that the dutch eredivisie couldn t offer fighting to find the back of the net against the likes of manchester united manchester city and chelsea is how you get better after all would albert pujols be better off playing the regular season in japan before heading to the world series you get better by playing better competition period added bonus the coach is happy we can watch him week in and week out klinsmann told ussoccer com we are all excited for jozy getting into this premier league season he will score his goals i have no doubt about it former usmnt weakness is turning into a strength given the growing depth of the player pool the evolution of altidore has solidified the americans as threat to any team that s not to say they d be favorites against any of the world s current top ten but each time they step onto the pitch the yanks can win in fact no coach in u s history has had as many positive options as klinsmann will take to the world cup in brazil now riding a 12 game win streak the longest ever for an american side altidore s growing reputation combined with the resurgence of landon donovan and the steady if not stellar presence of clint dempsey has turned the usmnt attack into a global threat as it stands now klinsmann has plenty of options for his high pressure up tempo attacking style of soccer what was once considered at weak spot for the americans is quickly turning into a strength up front alongside altidore the likely roster includes dempsey donovan and eddie johnson add to the mix a new generation of talented forwards aron johannsson brek shea brad davis chris wondolowski gomez and terrence boyd and the future is looking bright for the american game did we miss any of your favorite players or do you have any thoughts on american soccer that you d like to share we d love to hear from you tweet us up at kickrepublic or email tim kickrepublic com stephane sessegnon was charged with drink driving last week and his status for sunderland is
